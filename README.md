**Features:**

-Chat: The chat feature uses the websocket API to provide two way communication with the user's browser and the server. This results in a smooth realtime messaging ability.

-Chat history: Each user's chat history is stored in a slqlite database table, which lets the user revisit any conversation they have had in the past, or old messages.

-Map: The home page features a Map that I created with my previous experience in GIS. The map uses the google locaiton API, and shows the general location of other users that have logged in to the website, as well as a pin on the current users location. Each region of new zealand is coloured using a heat map, to show the most densely populated areas where users are active. This lets users see where they're most likely to meet new users.

-Sign Up: The sign up page allows the user to create a profile with personal information like their name, age, height, (google location prompt), 6 profile photos, and three unique captions which allows the user to show off their creative personality with responses to set questions they have choosen from.

-Sign In: The user can sign in using their login. The site also uses browser cookies that signs the user in automatically whenever the website is revisited on their browser.

-Profile Page: The profile page lets the user review their personal information and make updates to their profile pictures, aswell as their captions. 

-Friends page: The friends page contains two boxes. The first box shows up when the user has a friend request, and a little red notification dot is displayed on the friends navbar to indicate this. The user can accept the friend request, which will move that friend into the friends list. The friends list is shows all current friends, and allows them to engage in a chat with their friends.

-Sign Out: lets the user sign out of their account, redirecting them to the unauthenticated page, which prompts to sign in or sign up.
